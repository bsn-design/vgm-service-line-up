          p By pressing the Compact Mode button, you can easily see who is available by looking for the green areas. This really comes in handy when a customer calls and is wondering what days and times you have available. This feature alone will save you time and money in the long run.

          p To schedule an existing customer, start by typing their first or last name or even their phone number, and our smart search will quickly find your customer. Once found, press the Search button and click on the green available area of the person you want to send to the job that has availability. It will automatically enter them into the appointment, using the most likely duration that the customer has used in the past, so all you have to do is ensure the time is correct, add any other people to the job and save it. Simple as that.
