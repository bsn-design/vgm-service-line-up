        .section-main.flexed-grid
          p.two-up The <strong>New and Follow Up Report</strong> is what you generate when you want to follow-up with your customers. This report will show you new customers that you have been to as well as those customers that have been marked as “follow-up” so that your customer service and business as a whole is maintained. 
          p.two-up Sending a <strong>Follow-up Email</strong> to your contractors is a useful feature within Service Line Up. When you are talking to your customers, you can ask them about their experience with your company and then send that information to your contractors. This is a great way to see where you need to improve in your business practices and also lets your contractors know where they can improve or to let them know what a great job they did and how happy their customers were with them. Just go into the customers appointment and click on the Follow-up button, fill out the information and click on the Send button. That's it. Service Line Up will then send all the contractors that were on the job a follow-up email.
