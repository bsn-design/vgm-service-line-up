      </section>
      <section class="guide-section one-up">
        <h2 class="section-title">Changes to the Services</h2>
        <p>We have the right to change or modify, upgrade, add to, or discontinue the Services or any portion or feature thereof at any time without notice.  We also reserve the right to assign any rights, licenses, or obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service without restriction.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="guide-section one-up">
        <h2 class="section-title">Registration</h2>
        <p>You must register to access and use the Services.  If you are registering on behalf of a company, by registering you agree that you have the requisite authority to register on behalf of such company. The email address you provide during your registration will be the login for your Service Line Up account.  Each account must have a unique email address and you agree that you shall not attempt to create more than one account under the same email address.</p>
        <p>You represent that any information you provide during registration or at any time thereafter is true, accurate and complete and that you will update all such information as necessary to maintain its truth, accuracy and completeness.  Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Service.  You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and will be solely liable for all actions taken via your account and under your password, whether or not made with your knowledge or authority.  You further agree that any credit card information you provide during registration or at any time thereafter is valid and that you have authority to authorize payments from such credit card.</p>
        <p>By registering, you agree that you will use the Services only for the purposes advertised on our website or in other marketing material published by Service Line Up, that you are an individual or a valid business desiring to use the Services, and that any contact information you provide, such as email addresses and phone numbers, is valid and active contact information for you.</p>
      </section>

        <h2 class="section-title">Fees; Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>You agree to pay all charges as set forth on our website, in your Service Line Up account, and/or in these Terms of Service.  You agree that the address and email address you provide in your account settings are valid business addresses and that we may invoice you at such addresses or through other electronic or facsimile communications.  </p>
        <p>We reserve the right, at any time and at our discretion, to change any fees and any other pricing terms.  Any changes shall be posted on our website and/or in your Service Line Up account and will be effective immediately.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="guide-section one-up">
        <h2 class="section-title">Payment Authorization; Nonpayment</h2>
        <p>Subscriptions to Services are available on monthly and yearly subscription plans.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription. If you do not wish to renew the subscription, you agree to inform us at least seven days prior to the renewal date.  Subscription fees are due in advance, when Services are made available to you. By giving us your payment information (credit card information, bank account information, etc.), you expressly give us permission to charge you for all fees incurred in connection with your account.  For example, if you activated your account on June 1st (and you’re on a monthly billing cycle) fees for June are due in full on June 1st.  Fees for July will be due July 1st, and so forth.  With very few exceptions (such as honoring the terms of any applicable published money-back guarantee), once an amount has been charged to your credit card, it is nonrefundable.</p>
        <p>If we do not receive timely payment, we can suspend or terminate your account.  Any accrued but unpaid fees may accrue late charges at the rate of 1% of the balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and you give us permission to charge your account for such accrued and unpaid fees at any time on or after they have accrued.</p>
